## Commands
`!addvc`      Enables the bot for your connected voice channel.

`!removevc`   Disables the bot for your connected voice channel.

`!majority`   Sets what percentage of people have to be playing the same game for it to change the name. From 1-100.

`!template` Sets the template. Default: `!template X - Y`. 'X' represents the original channel name, and 'Y' represents the majority game. If no new template is provided it will reply with the currently set template.
